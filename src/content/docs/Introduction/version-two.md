title: Beauty of Mathematics V2
description: Introduction to the second version of the  Beauty of Mathematics website

I launched version two of the [Beauty of Mathematics](https://beautyofmathematics.com) in the month of June 2024. The original minimal design was a function of necessity [Using WordPress](/one/wordpress), I wanted to squeeze out all the performance I could. But, I couldn't achieve the desired results even with that simple design.

Enter Astro! Static sites are speedy by their nature. Astro ships no JavaScript out of the box. So, you can have a blog in static HTML and CSS. But you can also sprinkle in JavaScript if you wish. And Astro will handle it all using best practices to build your website.

The performance boost from a static site means that I don't need a minimal design anymore. That I can build something with more complexity. More images, video, and text. I could move beyond just using typography to showcase my content.

In light of this, the guide is updated with the learning gathered from building the second version of Beauty of Mathematics. You will see in some sections additional text added marked by "v2." This is updated information based on the changes that I made and what I learned.

I didn't feel the need to write new sections for all changes. I am adding an advanced section for Typescript, Props, and CSS Pseudo-elements. Look out for those changes.
